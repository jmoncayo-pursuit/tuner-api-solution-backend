## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jmoncayo-pursuit/tuner-api-solution-backend.git
   cd tuner-api-solution-backend

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Configuration:**
   - Create a PostgreSQL database for your application (e.g., `tuner`).
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Add your PostgreSQL connection details to the `.env` file:
     ```
     PORT=3346
     PG_HOST=localhost
     PG_PORT=5432
     PG_DATABASE=tuner
     PG_USER=postgres
     PG_PASSWORD=your_db_password 
     ```
   - Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials.

4. **Initialize and Seed the Database (Optional):**
   - If you want to set up the database schema and seed it with initial data, you can create `schema.sql` and `seed.sql` files.  
   - Run the following command to apply the schema: `psql -U your_db_user -d tuner -f schema.sql`
   - Seed the database (if you have a `seed.sql` file): `psql -U your_db_user -d tuner -f seed.sql` 

5. **Start the Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start on the port specified in your `.env` file (default: 3346).
